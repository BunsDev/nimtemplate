# nimtemplate 

simple template for building binaries or libraries with nim. 

This isn't a special template with a lot of whistles, it's the same thing you'd get with `nimble init` but with just a few common additions I do. 
- MIT License
- script to cross compile
- easy binary to library switch in the nimble file
